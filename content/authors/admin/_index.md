## About Me
I’m Luoting Zhuang, a PhD candidate in Medical Informatics at UCLA. My research focuses on identifying imaging biomarkers for pulmonary nodules and developing longitudinal models to track nodule changes over time. I aim to advance early detection and improve clinical decision-making in lung health.
