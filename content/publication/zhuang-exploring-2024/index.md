abstract: Image-based risk models have the potential to aid in the identification
  of individuals who would benefit from cancer screening. However, models need to
  be robust against variations in image acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
  which alter the appearance of images and may lead to different downstream predictions.
  We evaluated Sybil, an imaging-based lung cancer model that predicts up to six-year
  risk, on a lung cancer screening dataset that was acquired and reconstructed using
  a range of parameters. Using raw projection data from 169 retrospectively acquired
  low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans, we generated six image conditions for
  each case, varying reconstruction kernels (smooth, medium, sharp) and slice thicknesses
  (1.0mm, 2.0mm). Each image condition was processed and run through the pre-trained
  Sybil model in the same way. Variations in predicted risk scores were observed across
  various kernels and slice thicknesses, suggesting that deep features derived from
  LDCT scans can be sensitive to nuanced variations in acquisition and reconstruction
  parameters. Our study underscores the importance of enhancing understanding of how
  technical parameters impact predictive models like Sybil to enhance the reliability
  of model outputs, facilitating more accurate and robust clinical decision support.
