abstract: Cancer evolves continuously over time through a complex interplay of genetic,
  epigenetic, microenvironmental, and phenotypic changes. This dynamic behavior drives
  uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, posing
  challenges for effective monitoring and treatment. However, today’s data-driven
  research in oncology has primarily focused on cross-sectional analysis using data
  from a single modality, limiting the ability to fully characterize and interpret
  the disease’s dynamic heterogeneity. Advances in multiscale data collection and
  computational methods now enable the discovery of longitudinal multimodal biomarkers
  for precision oncology. Longitudinal data reveal patterns of disease progression
  and treatment response that are not evident from single-timepoint data, enabling
  timely abnormality detection and dynamic treatment adaptation. Multimodal data integration
  offers complementary information from diverse sources for more precise risk assessment
  and targeting of cancer therapy. In this review, we survey methods of longitudinal
  and multimodal modeling, highlighting their synergy in providing multifaceted insights
  for personalized care tailored to the unique characteristics of a patient’s cancer.
  We summarize the current challenges and future directions of longitudinal multimodal
  analysis in advancing precision oncology.
