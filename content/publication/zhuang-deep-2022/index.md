abstract: Management of aggressive malignancies, such as glioma, is complicated by
  a lack of predictive biomarkers that could reliably stratify patients based on treatment
  outcome. The complex mechanisms driving glioma recurrence and treatment resistance
  cannot be fully understood without the integration of multiscale factors such as
  cellular morphology, tissue microenvironment, and macroscopic features of the tumor
  and the host tissue. We present a weakly-supervised, interpretable, multimodal deep
  learning-based model fusing histology, radiology, and genomics features for glioma
  survival predictions. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of multimodal
  integration for improved survival prediction in glioma patients.
