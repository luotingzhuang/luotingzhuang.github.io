abstract: For patients with thyroid nodules, the ability to detect and diagnose a
  malignant nodule is the key to creating an appropriate treatment plan. However,
  assessments of ultrasound images do not accurately represent malignancy, and often
  require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Deep learning techniques can classify
  thyroid nodules from ultrasound images, but current methods depend on manually annotated
  nodule segmentations. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in the level of magnification
  across ultrasound images presents a significant obstacle to existing methods. We
  developed a multi-scale, attention-based multiple-instance learning model which
  fuses both global and local features of different ultrasound frames to achieve patient-level
  malignancy classification. Our model demonstrates improved performance with an AUROC
  of 0.785 (ptextless0.05) and AUPRC of 0.539, significantly surpassing the baseline
  model trained on clinical features with an AUROC of 0.667 and AUPRC of 0.444. Improved
  classification performance better triages the need for biopsy.
